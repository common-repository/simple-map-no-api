This is a very simple plugin that uses Google’s embed map feature. It allows users to display a location with a custom title on the map. Now with Block Editor support!

== Description ==
The Simple Google Map plugin for WordPress uses Google’s embed feature without requiring the Google Maps API.

This plugin allows you to display a Google Map on your website without needing to sign up for a Google Maps API key. You can easily embed maps by entering the latitude and longitude of the desired location, and a marker will show up on the map. The plugin also lets you set a custom title for the marker.

**What is New?**
With the new block editor integration, users can now insert maps directly through the WordPress Block Editor. The existing shortcode functionality still works, but users can also use the new block to configure the map settings directly in the editor.

**Features:**
- 100% responsive maps.
- No need for an API key.
- Customizable location markers with titles.
- Easy to use interface in the WordPress admin dashboard.
- Supports custom width and height for the map.
- New: Block Editor support for easier map insertion.

**How to use:**
1. Get the latitude and longitude of your desired location from [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps).
2. Go to the plugin settings in your WordPress dashboard and enter the details.
3. Use the shortcode [simpleMapNoApi] to display the map on any page or post. **Alternatively, use the "Simple Map Block" in the Block Editor.**
4. The shortcode will use the configuration set in the options panel, whereas the block will use the settings configured directly within the block editor.
